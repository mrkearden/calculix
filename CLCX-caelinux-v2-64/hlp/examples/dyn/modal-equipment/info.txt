Equipment On Springs
Eigenfrequencies and the corresponding eigenmodes 
of a structure (beam) with equipment on springs
This is the illustration of the rule, that mass of
equipment should not be taken into account when
calculating modes of rigid bearing structures (if springs are much more
flexible than beam modes are independent).
