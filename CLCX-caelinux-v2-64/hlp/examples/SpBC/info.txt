Special Types of BC
The main advantage of CalculiX is the ability to apply boundary conditions of different types, to solve practical problems.
Many FEA programs provide only simple BC, such as value of nodal displacement, pressure and force.
CalculiX has many useful card, like *TRANSFORM, *COUPLING, *EQUATION and etc.
