**Steel link with bolted ends
** Static problem with CCX Transform card
** Comparison with other software is provided.
** Parametric model is created in Salome-Platform 
** Double click by folder and look at pictures and py file for Salome.

*INCLUDE, INPUT=Mesh_CCX_OUT.inp


** We are using imperial units (the model is scaled in inches, pressure in psi)

*SOLID SECTION,ELSET=C3D10,MATERIAL=Steel,



** Apply Transform card to the nodal groups 'hole1' and 'hole2'
** We will use cylindrical coordinates for BC 
** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinate_system
** hole1 is located at 0,0,0
** hole 2 is located at 0,24,0
