** example: create rigid body for nset (with ROT NODE #1000002 at any position)
*node
1000002,0,0,0 

*RIGID BODY,nset=<..>,,ROT NODE=1000002

** moment should be applied within STEP card after *STEP and *STATIC

** Direction dir=1, for moment around 'X', 
** dir=2 and dir=3 should be used for moments around 'Y' AND 'Z'
*CLOAD
1000002,<dir>,<value>
