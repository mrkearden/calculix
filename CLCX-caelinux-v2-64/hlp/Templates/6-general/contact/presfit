** This sort of BC can be applied using CGX in Pre-Processor mode
** This case is considered with the ''presfit'' option in combination with the ''areampc'' option. 
** For example if a cylindrical press fit should be simulated then a forced displacement between 
** the two intersecting surfaces is necessary. This forces the dependent nodes to move to the independent face. 
** Two modes are available:

**    send dep indep abq areampc presfit f

** simulates sticking friction and with the option s

** send dep indep abq areampc presfit s

** works for sliding conditions. The user might request a certain value for the press fit if the overlapping of the mesh do not represent the necessary distance:

** send dep indep abq areampc presfit s0.06

** will move the dep-nodes 0.06 in the normal direction of the independent faces (works also with option f). 
** After applying this command new text file will be created in working folder (*INCLUDE it to calculation)
