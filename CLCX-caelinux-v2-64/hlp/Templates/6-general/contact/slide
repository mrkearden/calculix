 
 ** This sort of BC can be applied using CGX in Pre-Processor mode
 ** ''slide'' option in combination with the ''areampc'' option: For example if the mesh of a turbine-blade 
 ** and a disk should be connected with each other in a simpler but realistic way then a sliding condition 
 ** between this parts can be established. The command:

**    send dep indep abq areampc slide

** will connect the nodes in the set dep to element-faces described by nodes included in the set indep 
** but only in the direction perpendicular to a plane defined by nodes of the dep-set. 
** Therefore all dep-nodes and all indep-nodes must lie in the same plane and will slide in the same plane!
** After applying this command new text file will be created in working folder (*INCLUDE it to calculation)
