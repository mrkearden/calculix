 
**The conductance is the ratio of the 
**heat flow across the contact location 
**and the temperature difference between 
**the corresponding slave and master surface 
**unit: [energy]/([time]*[area]*[temperature])). 
 
** to be inserted after CONTACT PAIR, SURFACE INTERACTION
** and SURFACE BEHAVIOR  (see contact linear)

*GAP CONDUCTANCE
<value>

**optionally can be
**<Conductance>,<Contact pressure>,<Temperature>
