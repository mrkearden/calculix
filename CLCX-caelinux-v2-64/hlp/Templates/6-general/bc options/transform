** assigns a new cylindrical coordinate system with center at point 'a'. 
** to the nodes belonging to nodal set <..>. 
** The new X' axis will be in radial direction, the Z' axis in axial direction 
** and Y' is in tangential direction  (from point 'a' to point 'b')
** (such that X'-Y'-Z' is a right hand system)

** Second line:
**     X-coordinate of point a.
**     Y-coordinate of point a.
**     Z-coordinate of point a.
**     X-coordinate of point b.
**     Y-coordinate of point b.
**     Z-coordinate of point b.
