GMSH INP to CCX INP Converter.
python script at /scr/Converters/py_files/gi2ci.py

Create model in GMSH and export as INP (depend on groups defined, usually - without options selected)
To learn this converter -play with samples  and read PDF file in /samples/Converters/tests_dip28 folder.

Note:
This converter allows element type option (to produce plane stress/strain, axisymmetric, reduced integration and etc elements - read CCX help for details).
For plane stress/strain, axisymmetric elements directions of normales should be positive to avoid gen3dim issue (negative Jacobian).
Supports 2D-Tri(C2D3 , C2D6) or 3D-Tetra(C3D4 , C3D10) only
(cannot treat Recombined mesh , it will make 2D-Rect , 3D-prism , Hexa)
