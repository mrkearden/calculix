SI Units
All linear dimensions and displacements are in meters
(check if your mesh is scaled properly and bounding box
returns appropriate values for WxHxL)
Young's Modulus, Stress is in Pa,
Density is in kg/m^3
Force is in N
Gravity acceleration 9.81 m/s^2
Temperature is in K
Power is in Watt (W)
Energy is in J.
Thermal Conductivity W/(m degK)
Specific Heat J/(kg*degK)
