This feature uses *CLOAD card (with no options)
Read CCX help about that.
For solid bodies total force will be divided by number of nodes
and moment will be applied to the rigid body, created
For shells and beams total force and moment will be divided by number of nodes
in selected set.
*DISTRIBUTED COUPLING does the same, but with total force value under *CLOAD card
In this case distribution is provided with *DISTRIBUTED COUPLING card, generated.
