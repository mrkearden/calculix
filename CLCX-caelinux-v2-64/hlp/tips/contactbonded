This option is used to tie two surfaces. It can only be used with 3-dimensional elements (no plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric, beam or shell elements).Optional parameters are POSITION TOLERANCE, NAME, CYCLIC SYMMETRY and MULTISTAGE. The dependent surface is called the slave surface, the independent surface is the master surface. The user can freely decide which surface is taken as slave and which as master. The surfaces are defined using *SURFACE.
If no tolerance is specified, or the tolerance is smaller than $ 10^-10, a default tolerance is calculated equal to 2.5 % of the typical element size.
